# tic-tac-toe-project
## General Information
The purpose of this project is to create a Tic-Tac_toe game using React.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would prompt the users of the game to enter their names before starting the game so the board component displays the name who's turn it is to make a move. So it says "Jon it is your turn" Or "Mary it is your turn". Also the name of the player that wins will be displayed. I would use the prompt() JS built in function to get the user's name and store it in a variable.
